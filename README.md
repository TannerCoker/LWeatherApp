# LWeatherApp
LWeatherApp is a program that I am creating so that I can gain familiarity with using APIs. I am using "WeatherAPI" to pull in weather data.

## TestAPI.py
Currently the "TestAPI.py" program, in the development branch, will perform a simple weather app functionality from the windows CMD prompt. It can get weather based on either your current IP or you can search for a city. 

## Info
- Code currently resides in the Development branch.
- Working on adding a GUI to the program
