# LWeatherApp
LWeatherApp is a program that I am creating so that I can gain familiarity with using APIs. I am using "WeatherAPI" to pull in weather data.

## TestAPI.py
Currently the "TestAPI.py" program, in the development branch, will perform a simple weather app functionality from the windows CMD prompt. It can get weather based on either your current IP or you can search for a city. 

## Next steps
- Add further functionality
- Create a GUI for the app to display in
- Resolve issues with error checking
- Allow for more user input
  * Currently no way to specify which city user is wanting to request data from if there are multiple cities with the same name.
